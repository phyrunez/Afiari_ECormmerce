          your personal information within the Afiari Ecommerce website for the
          purchase of foodstuffs and other items. For the avoidance of doubt:
          personal information is information that identifies you or reasonably
          can be linked to information that identifies you. For example, when
          you place an order online, to fulfill your order we collect personal
          information, such as name, address, phone number, and credit or debit
          card information. If a Federal or any State Law defines “personal
          information” differently, we will use those definitions as they are
          applicable. Rest assured, though, that no matter where you live, we
          treat your personal information with respect, and we collect, use, and
          share it only as described in this Policy.
